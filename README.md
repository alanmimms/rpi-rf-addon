A 433MHz RF Raspberry Pi add-on for Hass.io.

## About

This was derived from [![This Python module][https://github.com/milaq/rpi-rf.git]]

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. [Add my Hass.io add-ons repository][hass.io-addons] to your Hass.io instance.

**NOTE**: Do not add this repository to Hass.io, please use:
`https://github.com/alanmimms/hass.io-addons`.

## Configuration

Even though this add-on is just an example add-on, it does come with
some configuration options to play around with.

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```json
{
  "log_level": "info",
  "seconds_between_quotes": 5
}
```

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `seconds_between_quotes`

Sets the number of seconds between the output of each quote. The value
must be between `1` and `120` seconds. This value is set to `5` seconds by
default.
